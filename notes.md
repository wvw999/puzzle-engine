This is an attempt to clone a popular word game, 'wordbrain'

It is being built out in three parts:

1. a puzzle generator that collects words from the dictionary (included) and saves them (complete except storage)
2. a puzzle solver that guarantees the puzzles created by #1 are solvable (in process)
3. the gameplay engine which allows a user to play the game (coming soon)

this project was initially being built out as an API, though, as the creation/solving aspect of this is time consuming, it is no longer an API

the board has been re-imagined, and is now a hash of X, Y values and an associated letter.

there is not currently any javascript front end, it will come as part of #3.
